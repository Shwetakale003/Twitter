            "Exercise is physical activity that we have to perform on a repetitive basis for relaxing our body and <br>taking away all the mental stress. It is important to do regular exercise. When you do this on a daily<br> basis, you become fit both physically and mentally. Moreover, not exercising daily can make a person<br>susceptible to different diseases. Thus, just like eating food daily, we must also exercise daily.",
